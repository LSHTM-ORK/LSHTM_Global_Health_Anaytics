    "text": "2.13 Encryption\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (EU) 2016/679 came in to force in May 2018 and this law requires that all reasonable steps should be taken to make it reasonably unlikely that personal and sensitive data relating to individuals and their health could be accessed or used by third parties without explicit consent.\nPLEASE NOTE\n\nGDPR makes no clear distinction between the use of names and pseudonyms or ID codes. Any data which can be linked to a living individual (by any person) is considered sensitive and ‘relevant’ to the GDPR.\nFully anonymous data sets (for instance where the project leads cannot link the data back to the origin in any way) are exempt from GDPR.\n\n  Project Level Encryption provides an extra layer of security by encrypting all data both on-device and on-server. This can be great for the extra security it brings, but it does lock you out of some excellent features of ODK. It is therefore worth taking time to carefully consider whether you need/want project level encryption.\nThe basic function of project level encryption is that you click a button on the settings page and set a single system wide password that is then used to encrypt and decrypt your data across all forms in your project. When you want to download and decrypt your data, you provide the password and all your data will then be downloaded to your computer as a zip file containing human-readable data.\nIf you forget or lose this password, there is no way to recover it and you will lose all your data. The password is never stored on the server, but is used as the secret key for decrypting data using cyphers that are stored by the server. Because of this, the system administrators cannot under any circumstance help you to recover the password."

    "section": "2.14 Appendix A : Form Level Encryption",
    "text": "2.14 Appendix A : Form Level Encryption\nWe use asymmetric encryption to protect the data on our system. This process is based on the use of a pair of cypher files or “Keys”. Each pair consists of a public key file, which is used for encryption and a private key which is used for decryption.\nThe private key is included in the ODK form on the Android devices. When a form is filled and finalised, the ODK Collect app uses the public key along with an encryption algorithm to convert the data in to an encoded (encrypted) form. Crucially, the same public key can not be used to decode (decrypt) the data, meaning that once the form is finalised, the data can not be reopened or read on the device. Any photographs, audio/video recordings and other attachments are also encrypted.\nThe encrypted form of the data is sent over the internet to the LSHTM server, where it is stored and backed up in the encrypted format.\nTo decrypt the data, it must first be downloaded from the server to your computer. A piece of software called ODK Briefcase is used to both download and decrypt the data. ODK Briefcase uses the private key file, meaning that only individuals who have a copy of this file (usually kept on a USB drive in a locked safe, office, filing cabinet etc) can ultimately see the human readable form of the data.\n\n2.14.0.1 Obtaining asymmetric encryption keys\nYou will need a unique pair of asymmetric encryption key files. Depending on how you want to use them, you could choose to either…\n\nUse the same key pair for all your projects and forms\n\nMost users do this\n\nUse different key pairs for specific projects\n\nUseful if sharing keys with project partners on specific projects\n\nUse different key pairs for specific forms\n\nThis advanced option is seldom used but can be implemented for multicentre projects where specific users should be locked out of some forms, but able to decrypt others\n\n\nThere are two options for how to do obtain your encryption key pairs.\n1. Obtain keys from LSHTM Global Health Analytics team\nWhen you set up your account, we will offer you a pair of encryption keys. Each set of keys can be either given to you in person on a USB drive or sent by Whatsapp, which provides a secure way to send the sensitive keys over the internet.\nFor backup purposes we will keep copies of all keys that we generate in our locked safe in the LSHTM Keppel Street Building.\n2. Make your own keys (Advanced Users)\nUsers who are familiar with such methods are welcome to generate their own keys using OpenSSL. OpenSSL is pre-installed on Mac and Linux systems, but will need to be installed on Windows PCs.\nA 2048 bit private key should be created (do NOT add a passcode to the key).\nOn Windows, a typical set of commands to create a private key, then extract a public key are…\n\nopenssl genpkey -out MyPrivateKey.pem -outform PEM -algorithm RSA -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048\n\n\nopenssl rsa -in MyPrivateKey.pem -inform PEM -out MyPublicKey.pem -outform PEM -pubout\n\nOn Macs/Linux, these commands would be similar to…\n\nopenssl genrsa -out MyPrivateKey.pem 2048\n\n\nopenssl rsa -in MyPrivateKey.pem -inform PEM -out MyPublicKey.pem -outform PEM -pubout\n\nIn both cases you may wish to substitute MyPrivateKey and MyPublicKey for something more descriptive.\n\n\n\nAfter you have obtained your encryption key files\nYou should have two files, with names something like this…\n\nODK.PRIVATE.KEY.11110.pem\nODK.PUBLIC.KEY.11110.pem\n\nOpen the public key file in a text editor.\nOn Macs\n\nright click the file and choose open with then other and choose TextEdit\n\nOn PCs >right click the file and choose open with and choose Notepad\nYou should see a block of text like this >—–BEGIN PUBLIC KEY—–\nMIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEA1DXk7dbAI89DscB5M+aB lbvtIUcelkwdYX+CBV9uHdvkCm6g0CJM0nrzjRrhKyty0hSgIRfhIBozIfEJYSwR usz/ClGeNiL8Fz3JGYfnFWLw4ZmNKQwAz2CS/zoI4Mu7QRjmeWPIBohdjHo1hJNI jogme0Iip4GDn+3DgsuvFYXxjkWlXN7opEkxAeBQukQzAxCiWbwdhKWKQzwgzmSu 5HqCldkkQQ1Q5Zd/KsdmejWQa/5xDd/gOJ0ql+AVzZC1Z9fE0+2HLEEQca8pgWUP XAnPEK2BdNI/ltfPhgKOCE1inXAZxIrDSybePUIyYbIj14aQ30osMpp4EMFFU1rY bQIDAQAB\n—–END PUBLIC KEY—–\nCopy this text and paste it in to a new text file named something like ODK.PUBLIC.KEY.11110.txt\nRemove the top and bottom lines…\n\nMIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEA1DXk7dbAI89DscB5M+aB lbvtIUcelkwdYX+CBV9uHdvkCm6g0CJM0nrzjRrhKyty0hSgIRfhIBozIfEJYSwR usz/ClGeNiL8Fz3JGYfnFWLw4ZmNKQwAz2CS/zoI4Mu7QRjmeWPIBohdjHo1hJNI jogme0Iip4GDn+3DgsuvFYXxjkWlXN7opEkxAeBQukQzAxCiWbwdhKWKQzwgzmSu 5HqCldkkQQ1Q5Zd/KsdmejWQa/5xDd/gOJ0ql+AVzZC1Z9fE0+2HLEEQca8pgWUP XAnPEK2BdNI/ltfPhgKOCE1inXAZxIrDSybePUIyYbIj14aQ30osMpp4EMFFU1rY bQIDAQAB\n\n…and carefully remove the line breaks (returns), taking care not to delete any characters from the key. Your aim is to get all the characters on one line, as shown below.\n\nMIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEA1DXk7dbAI89DscB5M+aBlbvtIUcelkwdYX+CBV9uHdvkCm6g0CJM0nrzjRrhKyty0hSgIRfhIBozIfEJYSwRuszClGeNiL8Fz3JGYfnFWLw4ZmNKQwAz2CSzoI4Mu7QRjmeWPIBohdjHo1hJNIjogme0Iip4GDn+3DgsuvFYXxjkWlXN7opEkxAeBQukQzAxCiWbwdhKWKQzwgzmSu5HqCldkkQQ1Q5Zd/KsdmejWQa/5xDd/gOJ0ql+AVzZC1Z9fE0+2HLEEQca8pgWUPXAnPEK2BdNI/ltfPhgKOCE1inXAZxIrDSybePUIyYbIj14aQ30osMpp4EMFFU1rYbQIDAQAB\n\nSave the ODK.PUBLIC.KEY.11110.txt file for later. You will use this ‘one-liner’ key when you design your data collection forms. Please note that ODK form design is covered in a separate guide. For the remainder of this guide we will use a simple template form which you can download here.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.14.0.2 Downloading and Decrypting Data using ODK Briefcase (Form level encryption only)\nIn order to be able to decrypt your data, your computer’s installation of Java may need to be updated. This is because the decryption requires advanced cryptography files that are not included in all Java releases.\n\nDownload and install Java Development Kit V10. Be sure to install the correct version for your operating system.\nReboot your computer.\nDownload the most recent version of ODK Briefcase. This is a java executable file named something like ODK-Briefcase-v1.10.1.jar.\n\nMove the ODK Briefcase vx.x.x.jar file to a folder on your hard drive\n\nDouble click to open the ODK Briefcase Software.\n\nBecause this is a Java Application, you may have to allow the program security privileges on some computers.\n\nOn Mac OS you may need to go to System Preferences > security & privacy then unlock the preference pane and click Anywhere under the Allow apps downloaded from section.\n\nSelect the Settings tab\n\nClick the Choose... button and select a location to which the software should pull your raw data files.\n\n\nNOTE : The folder you use for ODK Briefcase Storage should not be a folder on a filesharing system such as Dropbox, nor a folder which is automatically backed up to an unsecured drive.\n\n\n\n\nSelect the Pull tab and click the Configure button.\n\nEnter the URL of your server, this time adding the main data folder in the path\n\n\nURL\nhttps://yourprojectname.odk.lshtm.ac.uk/yourprojectname\n\nor\n\nhttps://ork.lshtm.ac.uk/yourprojectname\n\n\nUsername\nadmin\nPassword\ngrapes$CATCH$brickred$fudge\n\n\nPress the ‘Connect’ button and ODK Briefcase should show you a list of all the forms that you can copy from the server on to your local (desktop/laptop) machine. This action is called a ‘pull’.\n\n\n\nTick the box next to the forms you want to pull or press the select all button.\n\nPress the Pull button to pull your data in to the folder you specified earlier.\n\nAll successfulls pulls will be flagged success in the Pull Status column.\n\nIn your download folder you will now find that there are a number of new directories.\n> ODK Briefcase Storage\n    >forms\n         >tutorial_encrypted\n                >instances\n    >uuid….\nThere will be one uuid folder for each filled form that you submitted to the server. Inside each of these folders you will find encrypted files.\n\nSelect the export tab and click the choose button next to Export Directory.\nChoose a directory in which to export the decrypted data. This must be a different folder to the one in which the encrypted files are stored.\nThis folder should not be on Dropbox etc. nor on any folder backed up to enencrypted media.\nClick the choose button next to PEM File location.\n\nLocate the private decryption key (This should be on a USB drive).\n\nSelect the forms you wish to decrypt.\n\nPress Export.\n\n\n\nExport Status will change to Succeeded if everything went well.\nIn the export directory you will find a new folder called decrypted\nInside this foilder should be a csv file, which can be opened by R, STATA, Excel or text editors. Please note that Excel has poor support for non Roman characters, so surveys in other alphabets may not show correctly.\nIf there are photos, videos or sound recordings in your form, there will be a media folder which contains these. The file paths to these media files will be updated automatically in the CSV document."

Whilst the server is able to handle very large projects without other users seeing performance drops, the system can become unstable when there is very high demand for data transfers from the server to client machines. This infrequently occurs, but can do so when users request large amounts of data with high frequency.\nUsers should not therefore attempt to create real-time high demand data links, or to build real time dashboards that utilise data from the Central server. If you plan to create any kind of dashboard that pulls data directly from the Central server with high demand, then you should first discuss this with our team via odk@lshtm.ac.uk. Dashboards should update at most once a day, preferably between 0000 and 0500 UTC. \nUsers in violation of this policy may have their accounts suspended without warning."

Full details of how to use it are here.\nTo connect your ODK Central account to R, you’ll need to set up your passwords in the r.environ file so they’re not exposed in scripts. Your passwords will be stored in plain text on your r.environ so be cautious about which machines you work with this way. There’s also options to add you password manually each time, but we’ll assume you’re on a secure machine when you do this."

    "text": "2.15 Frequently Asked Question (FAQ)\nI can’t access my project, what should I do?\nOften these issues are temporary and relate to a specific user, their location and their internet access point.\n\nTry logging in from another WiFi or mobile internet connection.\nAsk another web-user who has access to your project to try to log in using their credentials\nClear the cache on your browser and then try again\n\nOccasionally these issues are due to a system outage. We have automatic systems in place which reboot the system every 24 hours.\n\nWait until tomorrow and try again\n\nDo I need to have ethics permission before I set up my project?\nNo but you do need ethics permission before you start collecting data.\nCan I get help with designing forms?\nYes, you can contact us for help, but you should have a go yourself before you do. We are here for the hard parts. There’s great advice here https://docs.getodk.org/form-design-intro/\nI don’t know anything about data management. What can I do to learn the basics?\nThere’s lots of great stuff on the internet and here’s some stuff to get you started\n\nWe have a recorded lecture from our MSc programme, where Chrissy Roberts presents a broad and basic introduction to data science for epidemiology.\nODK’s documentation is brilliant and the online community of the ODK Forum is a knowledgable and supportive place to seek help\nFor general data analysis/management learning we recommend R for Data Science\nDr Michael Marks has produced a guide which follows the examples of LSHTM’s Clinical Epidemiology module, written in R\nFor more advanced and specifically epidemiological analysis, the Epidemiologist R Handbook is brilliant\n\nI can’t afford to make a Pay What You Can payment, will you let me use the system?\n\nYes\n\nI’m based outside LSHTM, can I still use the system?\nYes, if you are collaborating with someone from LSHTM, but it can get complicated, so contact us to discuss this on a case by case basis\n\nSometimes a commercial provider is a better option\n\nI’m not doing research, can I use ODK for internal data management/collection/survey work?\nYes, we use ODK internally for lots of things like monitoring student progress, or doing internal surveys, forms and so on. You should always check what needs to go through ethics and what doesn’t. This can be quite complicated."
